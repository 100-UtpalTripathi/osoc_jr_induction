Creation of Merge Conflict:
    Firstly I created conflict.txt file in new branch then same named file in main branch but
    text content of both the files are different at same lines so this will result into merge conflict
    when we try to merge new branch to main branch.


Resolving Merge Conflict:
    I have three choices:
	1. I can accept the changes of main branch. OR
	2. I can accept the changes of new branch. OR
	3. I can accept the changes of both branches.
    In my case,I accepted the changes of both branches.
